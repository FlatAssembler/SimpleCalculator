License Grants and Conditions&#xa;--------------------------------&#xa;&#xa;2.1. Grants&#xa;&#xa;Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,&#xa;non-exclusive license:&#xa;&#xa;(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)&#xa;    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,&#xa;    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its&#xa;    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or&#xa;    as part of a Larger Work; and&#xa;&#xa;(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer&#xa;    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its&#xa;    Contributions or its Contributor Version.&#xa;&#xa;2.2. Effective Date&#xa;&#xa;The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution&#xa;become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first&#xa;distributes such Contribution.&#xa;&#xa;2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope&#xa;&#xa;The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under&#xa;this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the&#xa;distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.&#xa;Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a&#xa;Contributor:&#xa;&#xa;(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;&#xa;    or&#xa;&#xa;(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&apos;s&#xa;    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its&#xa;    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor&#xa;    Version); or&#xa;&#xa;(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of&#xa;    its Contributions.&#xa;&#xa;This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,&#xa;or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with&#xa;the notice requirements in Section 3.4).&#xa;&#xa;2.4. Subsequent Licenses&#xa;&#xa;No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to&#xa;distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this&#xa;License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if&#xa;permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).&#xa;&#xa;2.5. Representation&#xa;&#xa;Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its&#xa;Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights&#xa;to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.&#xa;&#xa;2.6. Fair Use&#xa;&#xa;This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under&#xa;applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other&#xa;equivalents.&#xa;&#xa;2.7. Conditions&#xa;&#xa;Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted&#xa;in Section 2.1.&#xa;&#xa;3. Responsibilities&#xa;-------------------&#xa;&#xa;3.1. Distribution of Source Form&#xa;&#xa;All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any&#xa;Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under&#xa;the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source&#xa;Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this&#xa;License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not&#xa;attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code&#xa;Form.&#xa;&#xa;3.2. Distribution of Executable Form&#xa;&#xa;If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:&#xa;&#xa;(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code&#xa;    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of&#xa;    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code&#xa;    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more&#xa;    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and&#xa;&#xa;(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this&#xa;    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the&#xa;    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter&#xa;    the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.&#xa;&#xa;3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work&#xa;&#xa;You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,&#xa;provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for&#xa;the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered&#xa;Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the&#xa;Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this&#xa;License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software&#xa;under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of&#xa;the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered&#xa;Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary&#xa;License(s).&#xa;&#xa;3.4. Notices&#xa;&#xa;You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices&#xa;(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,&#xa;or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of&#xa;the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to&#xa;the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.&#xa;&#xa;3.5. Application of Additional Terms&#xa;&#xa;You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,&#xa;indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered&#xa;Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on&#xa;behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any&#xa;such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by&#xa;You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any&#xa;liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,&#xa;indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional&#xa;disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any&#xa;jurisdiction.&#xa;&#xa;4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation&#xa;---------------------------------------------------&#xa;&#xa;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this&#xa;License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to&#xa;statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with&#xa;the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)&#xa;describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must&#xa;be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered&#xa;Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute&#xa;or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a&#xa;recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&#xa;&#xa;5. Termination&#xa;--------------&#xa;&#xa;5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically&#xa;if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become&#xa;compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular&#xa;Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such&#xa;Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an&#xa;ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the&#xa;non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have&#xa;come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular&#xa;Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor&#xa;notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the&#xa;first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License&#xa;from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after&#xa;Your receipt of the notice.&#xa;&#xa;5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent&#xa;infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,&#xa;counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version&#xa;directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to&#xa;You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section&#xa;2.1 of this License shall terminate.&#xa;&#xa;5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all&#xa;end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which&#xa;have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License&#xa;prior to termination shall survive termination.&#xa;&#xa;************************************************************************&#xa;*                                                                      *&#xa;*  6.

This   *&#xa;*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *&#xa;*  personal injury resulting from such party&apos;s negligence to the       *&#xa;*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *&#xa;*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *&#xa;*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *&#xa;*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *&#xa;*                                                                      *&#xa;************************************************************************&#xa;&#xa;8. Litigation&#xa;-------------&#xa;&#xa;Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the&#xa;courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal&#xa;place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that&#xa;jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.&#xa;Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&apos;s ability to bring&#xa;cross-claims or counter-claims.&#xa;&#xa;9. Miscellaneous&#xa;----------------&#xa;&#xa;This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject&#xa;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xa;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent&#xa;necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides&#xa;that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter&#xa;shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.&#xa;&#xa;10. Versions of the License&#xa;---------------------------&#xa;&#xa;10.1. New Versions&#xa;&#xa;Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section&#xa;10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or&#xa;publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a&#xa;distinguishing version number.&#xa;&#xa;10.2. Effect of New Versions&#xa;&#xa;You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version&#xa;of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,&#xa;or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license&#xa;steward.&#xa;&#xa;10.3. Modified Versions&#xa;&#xa;If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to&#xa;create a new license for such software, you may create and use a&#xa;modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove&#xa;any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that&#xa;such modified license differs from this License).&#xa;&#xa;10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary&#xa;Licenses&#xa;&#xa;If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With&#xa;Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the&#xa;notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.&#xa;&#xa;Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice&#xa;-------------------------------------------&#xa;&#xa;  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public&#xa;  License, v. 2.0.
